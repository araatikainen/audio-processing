# Audio processing project

## Overview

This repository contains documentation and code for an Audio Processing project aimed at building a machine learning model to predict vehicles (cars and buses) based on passing-by audio samples. Training audiosamples are from freesound and test samples are recorded by me. More information about project can be found at documentation.pdf\
